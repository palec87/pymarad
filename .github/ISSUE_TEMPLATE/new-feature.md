**Is your feature request related to a problem? If yes, please describe:**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Did you consider a bug report?

**Describe main topics you'd like to cover:**
 - Field (subfield): [e.g. psychology (paradox fo choice)]
 - Python: [e.g. for loops, matplotlib]
 - Math: [e.g. derivative, sine function]

**Sequence of steps along the project:**
Ex.
1. Search and load data
2. Plot a graph.
3. Calculate a derivative.
4. Integrate it
5. What is it good for

**Main points you want to convey:**
Ex.
1. Derivatives have mothing in common with a paradox of choice
2. Not every smooth function is differentiable
3. Now you can try to optimize fuel consumption of a plane. 

**Other context or references:**
Add any other context or screenshots about the project.
