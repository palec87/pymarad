# Pymarad
Collection of tutorials/projects from all fields of life using high-shool math and Python, not only for the high school students.

## New [Pymarad App](https://pymarad-app.herokuapp.com/)
  * Contains project demos.
  * teases you with some results.
  * Provides links.

Back to Pymarad itself..

## If you do not have Python installed:
There are several options how to run Jupyter Notebooks freely on 3rd party servers:

1. Open repository on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/palec87/pymarad/HEAD). In the left-hand side panel, you will be able to browse folders containing all the projects, as well as the introductory Notebooks.
2. Pick a notebook and open in Google colab environment (needs Google account) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/palec87/pymarad/blob/)
3. Amazon sagemaker studio (needs free account creation to actually run the NBs) [![Open in Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/studiolab.svg)](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/import/github/palec87/pymarad/blob/main/en/05_probability/wee_sea_task.ipynb)
    * This link opens a preview of one of the projects. 
    * I do not know about the way to browse through the hierarchy of all the projects.
    * After singing in, you can however clone whole pymarad repository (all the projects) into your environment.

At the moment, my preference for the environments (and testing all the functionalities) goes in order of the above list.

## Project are introduced on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9FRDaR5N5AzggJGQUaiCTQ) too.

## List of projects available up to date (alphabetical)
### Fully working
* Percentages
    1. Intro NB
        * Relation between percentages and fractions.
        * importance of which total we take percentage from.
        * Examples
    2. Emptiness of the world
        * If we take extend of molecules as radii of electronic clouds of their constituting atoms, how much EMPTY space are we going to find in water volume?
        * Chemistry, percentages, unit conversions, Avogadro constant, Van der Walls/covalent radius of atoms.
* Probability
    1. Pee in the sea
        * You pee in the ocean and you perfectly mix everything. Then you draw a glass of water out of the ocean, how many pee molecules will you find?
        * Chemistry, Avogadro constant, isotopes, binomial (hypergeometrical) distribution, unit conversion, for loops in Python, scipy.stats module
* Quadratic equation
    1. Intro NB
        * Basic properties of quadratic function
        * graph, apex, discriminant, intersection, focus.
    2. Buying Pizza
        * When does it pay of to buy 2 smaller pizzas rather than 1 bigger one?
        * Compare sizes of pizzas, solving quad. equation, define functions in Python, fsolve(), plotting graphs.
    3. Selling lemonade
        * Calculate your profits based on the demand curve for your product, investment cost etc.
        * Economics, demand curve, quadratic function, interpolation of functions.
* Sets
    1. Forest fires and arson
        * You are trying identify countries soft on arson crime. If you convince them to step up, you can save lots of CO<sub>2</sub>, lives and money.
        * Ecology, forest fires, arson, GDP per capita, pandas module, set operations, Venn diagrams.

### Under development
* Goniometry
  1. Intro to Fourier transform
        * Approximation of a square wave with sine functions.
        * Interactive plotting with plotly. 
  2. Create a new musical instrument:
        * How come that even though a tone is a single wave, you can recognize instrument which plays it?
        * Find out what gives instruments their timbre and based on that create your own new instrument sound.
        * Music, sine function, physics of waves, Fourier transform, frequency vs. time
* Vectors
  1. Diet analyzer
        * Compare diets in terms of how much calories they give? Are they sustainable, what about your diet? Is it possible to feed all people in the world like that?
        * Food security, water/land consumption, vectors and vector spaces.
